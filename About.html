    <p class="aboutp1">
      I am very passionate about Art, a reason being because of the familiar feeling I have when I am either painting, drawing a sketch or thinking of something abstract I want to experiment with. I have always wanted to take classes on arts or visual arts but, it's is not an activity readily available to all, especially with schools not taking interest in pursuing the thought. So, I wanted to create this website to display the benefits of an art program in schools.

      <br>
      I am also very passionate of music, mainly because of my family and their involvement in music and music production. They have all helped me in discovering my musicsal interest and give me great advice of how to improve, and they continue to do so. That factor made me want to share the feeling of learning about musics, the composition, the feeling of learning a new song and playing without mistakes.
